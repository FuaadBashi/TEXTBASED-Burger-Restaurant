# TEXTBASED-Burger-Restaurant
This Java-based project is a Restaurant Ordering System designed to replicate the ordering process for a burger place. It offers a user-friendly interface for customers to customise their meals by selecting burgers, sides, drinks, and optional toppings. The system dynamically calculates the total price based on the chosen options and sizes.
